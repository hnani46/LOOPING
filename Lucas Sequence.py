.....
a = 0, b=0, c=1 are the 1st three terms. All other terms in the Lucas sequence are generated by the sum of their 3 most recent predecessors. Write a program to generate the first n terms of a Lucas Sequence.
....
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
0 0 1 1 2
....
Ans:
n=int(input())
a=0
b=0
c=1
print(a,end=’ ‘)
print(b,end=’ ‘)
print(c,end=’ ‘)
for i in range (4,n+1):
	d=a+b+c
	a=b
	b=c
	c=d
	print(d,end=’ ‘)
code:
def generate_lucas_sequence(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 0]
    elif n == 3:
        return [0, 0, 1]
    
    # Initialize the sequence with the first three terms
    sequence = [0, 0, 1]
    
    # Generate the rest of the terms
    for i in range(3, n):
        next_term = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-3]
        sequence.append(next_term)
    
    return sequence

# Example usage:
try:
    n = int(input("Enter the number of terms you want to generate in the Lucas sequence: "))
    lucas_sequence = generate_lucas_sequence(n)
    print(f"The first {n} terms of the Lucas sequence are: {lucas_sequence}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer.")
....
output:
The first 10 terms of the Lucas sequence are: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44]
